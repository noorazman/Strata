// include/strata/kernels/fused_gr.hpp - plan v0.3 P3: the hyper-connection read in TWO kernels, with the
// previous half's write folded in.
//
// The native path spends six kernels per `gr_read` (norm, down MMVF, silu, up MMVF, gate+mean, inject MMVF) and
// one per `gr_write`, 96 + 96 times per token, and its up projection (10240 rows of 320) runs one 160-thread
// block per row: 20.6 us for 6.5 MB.  Here:
//
//   fused_gr_down : R' = R + bo_prev * 2 sigmoid(inj_prev / hc)  (only when `apply`, computed on the fly)
//                   rs[c] = rsqrt(mean(R'[c]^2) + eps),  xn = R' * w_norm * rs
//                   lo[k] = silu((w_down[k] . xn) / hc)          k < hc_lr
//                   inject[c] = w_inject[c] . xn                 when w_inject is given
//   fused_gr_up   : R <- R' in place for this block's columns (when `apply`)
//                   mixed[d] = mean_c  xn[c,d] * sigmoid(w_up[c*n_embd + d] . lo)
//
// FP32 activations and BF16 weights, like the native MMVF contract; the summation order differs from it (G-C
// judges the result).  Geometry is the artifact's: n_embd 2560, hc 4, hc_lr 320.  `inj_prev` and `inject_out`
// must be different buffers (every block reads the former while one block writes the latter).
