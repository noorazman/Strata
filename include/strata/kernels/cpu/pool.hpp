// include/strata/kernels/cpu/pool.hpp - P2.S3: the CPU expert pool.
//
// A layer runs TEN experts against ONE activation, and the expert kernel is DRAM-bound (Memory/LEDGER.md L9:
// 42.55 GB/s on 6 cores, tracking core count almost exactly).  So the pool's job is not to be clever - it is
// to keep every physical core reading expert bytes for the whole layer, and to be cheap enough that ten
// dispatches per layer cost less than one expert.
//
// WHY A FLAT BATCH AND NOT A RING.  P2.S3 describes a "lock-free SPMC ring", which is what you need when
// jobs arrive while others are still being computed.  Here they cannot: the host must SUM all ten outputs
// before the next layer starts, so a layer is a barrier by construction and the queue never holds more than
// one batch.  A ring would add a wrap-around to get wrong and buy nothing.  What is kept from the phase is
// the part that matters: `head`/`done` are single fetch_add counters, one claim per worker, no lock.
//
// THE COMPLETION PROTOCOL, because this is where a pool usually goes wrong.  `run()` waits for `done == n`
// AND for every worker to PARK.  Waiting only for `done` is not enough: a worker can still be inside the
// drain loop after its last `done` increment, and the host resetting `head` underneath it would let that
// worker claim a job from the NEXT batch before the next batch has been published.
//
// **AND `parked` IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER (issue #29).**  A worker that went to sleep (after `kSpinBeforeSleep`) is
// still counted as parked when it wakes, so for a moment after it has seen a new epoch the host believes it is
// idle.  On a card with most experts in VRAM the workers sleep in the middle of a request, tiny batches finish
// before a sleeper is awake, and that moment comes round constantly: a late worker could claim from the NEXT
// batch while the host was still writing it, run a job twice, or add to `done` after the host had reset it -
// and `done != n` then never ended, with the GPU waiting on the pool forever.  So every claim carries its
// batch: `head` is one 64-bit word `epoch | njobs | index`, a claim is a CAS that only succeeds for the epoch
// the worker woke for, and a late worker's claim simply fails.  A claim that succeeds belongs to the current
// batch, whose description the host cannot change until that job's `done` has landed.
