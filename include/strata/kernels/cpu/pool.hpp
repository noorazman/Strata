// include/strata/kernels/cpu/pool.hpp - P2.S3: the CPU expert pool.
//
// A layer runs TEN experts against ONE activation, and the expert kernel is DRAM-bound (Memory/LEDGER.md L9:
// 42.55 GB/s on 6 cores, tracking core count almost exactly).  So the pool's job is not to be clever - it is
// to keep every physical core reading expert bytes for the whole layer, and to be cheap enough that ten
// dispatches per layer cost less than one expert.
//
// WHY A FLAT BATCH AND NOT A RING.  P2.S3 describes a "lock-free SPMC ring", which is what you need when
// jobs arrive while others are still being computed.  Here they cannot: the host must SUM all ten outputs
// before the next layer starts, so a layer is a barrier by construction and the queue never holds more than
// one batch.  A ring would add a wrap-around to get wrong and buy nothing.  What is kept from the phase is
// the part that matters: `head`/`done` are single fetch_add counters, one claim per worker, no lock.
//
// THE COMPLETION PROTOCOL, because this is where a pool usually goes wrong.  `run()` waits for `done == n`
// AND for every worker to PARK.  Waiting only for `done` is not enough: a worker can still be inside the
// drain loop after its last `done` increment, and the host resetting `head` underneath it would let that
// worker claim a job from the NEXT batch before the next batch has been published.  The
// `done`-then-`parked` pair makes the handover unambiguous, and the second wait costs a few hundred cycles
// against a layer that takes milliseconds.
